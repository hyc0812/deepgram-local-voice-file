Then let's replace line 8 and 9 with our voice file path and mimetype 
(Hint: use a new CLI to navigate to the directory where your voice file is located and use `pwd` to acquire absolute path):

Now lastly let's run our application with the following command (Make sure you are at /sttApp):
```linux

```
And youâ€™ll receive a JSON response including a transcript that you want, including word arrays, timings, and confidence scores:
